1. The player is colliding with the relevant trigger collider and presses E (OnTriggerStay2D() of ExamineTrigger).
2. If some prerequisites are met, TriggerDialogue() of DialogueTrigger is called for the current index of the matrix of dialogues (DialogueTrigger[]).
3. If the next dialogue cannot be triggered, the static dialogue is triggered.
4. TriggerDialogue() calls CanTriggerDialogue() (from DialogueTrigger as well).
5. If CanTriggerDialogue() returns true, TriggerDialogue() calls StartDialogue(dialogue) from the relevant dialogueManager.
6. StartDialogue(dialogue) displays the sentences queued on the relevant dialogue. DisplayNextSentence() is called after each sentence is fully printed.
7. If DisplayNextSentence() runs out of sentences, it calls EndDialogue(). This, among other things, advances the current phase.
